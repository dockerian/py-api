HP Helion Development Platform Client
==================================
The 'helion' client is the command-line interface to HP Helion Development Platform
You can use this client to push application code to a HP Helion Development 
Platform system, start and stop applications, create data services or link them to
applications, and perform a number of other management operations.
Each HP Helion Development Platform VM will have the corresponding client release
available for download from the Management Console.
  
Client Installation
-------------------
  * Unpack the archive
  * Rename the executable file for your OS/platform to ‘helion’
  * Move it to (or symlink it from) a system PATH directory, or add an
    alias in your shell
  * For Linux or Mac OS X: Make sure the file is set as executable
    (`chmod +x helion`). On some systems read access is also necessary
    (`chmod 755 helion`).
