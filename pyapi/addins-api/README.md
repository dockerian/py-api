# Addins Catalog API Service
This service is a local catalog API of addins installed within a customer's Helion cloud.


## Development Guidelines

### Development Environment Setup
The easiest method is to setup a virtual environment. If you have `virtualenv` installed run `virtualenv .venv` (the `.venv` directory is gitignored) and `source .venv/bin/activate` to prepare the environment.
```
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once you have the environment ready you can run `make dev-setup` to install the dependencies.
```
make dev-setup
```

Before you can begin developing you'll need to setup a development configuration. Copy the file `development.ini.dst` to `development.ini`. In this file you can configure elements of the setup including the server and port it runs on.


### To run the API (web) server
To run as a serve in development mode use `make serve`. This will start up a server based on the configuration in `development.ini` and be setup to watch for code changes where it reloads the server.
```
make serve
```
*Note, this runs as a WSGI server and content is not persisted between requests.
To persist data an external data store will need to be used.*


### List Routes
The pyramid docs tell us how to [list routes](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/commandline.html#displaying-matching-views):
```
.venv/bin/proutes development.ini
```
